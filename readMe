The intent of this program is to calculate the Routh Hurwitz Stability Table given an nth order system
Hopefully, the program will be able to generate MATLAB code upon completion.

This is written a top-down program. The pseudocode can be seen below.

Obtain the nth order of the system
While the current iteration is less than the nth order
    Obtain ith coefficient
Create nth arrays
Calculate if order is even or odd
If the order is even
    Fill nth array with nth order coefficient, skipping one until at 0th coefficient
    Fill nth - 1 array with nth-1 order coefficient, skipping one until at 1th coefficient and then place a zero
If the order is odd
    Fill nth array with nth-1 order coefficient, skipping one until at 1th coefficient and then place a zero
    Fill nth - 1 array with nth order coefficient, skipping one until at 0th coefficient
While current iteration is less than nth - 1
    Get size of nth & nth - 1 array
    Calculate (nth - 1) - iteration array
